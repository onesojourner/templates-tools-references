# Key Semantic Elements Used

NOTE ON BOILERPLATE TEMPLATES WITH VS CODE: VS Code has a shortcut. Delete everything in the index.html file. Click the ! and you'll be presented with a couple of options. Choose the first option.

The template above uses several semantic tags to clearly define the structure of the page:

* !DOCTYPE html: Declares the document type and version (HTML5).

* html lang="en": The root element, specifying the language of the document for accessibility and search engines.

* head: Contains metadata about the document (not displayed on the page).

* meta charset="UTF-8": Ensures proper character encoding for a wide range of languages.

* meta name="viewport: Ensures proper rendering and touch zooming on mobile devices.

* title: Defines the title of the page, shown in the browser's title bar or tab.

* body: Contains all the visible content of the webpage.

* header: Represents the introductory content or a group of introductory aids, often containing the site logo, headings, and navigation.

* nav: Defines a section that contains navigation links.

* main: The dominant content of the body, unique to this document.

* article: Encloses self-contained content, such as a blog post or news story.

* section: Defines a section of a document, often with a heading.

* aside: Defines content that is tangentially related to the content around it (like a sidebar).

* footer: Defines the footer for the document or a section, typically containing information about the author, copyright, or related links.

* script defer: Links a JavaScript file and ensures it runs after the HTML has been parsed, preventing the page load from being blocked.
